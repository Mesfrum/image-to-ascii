# Image to ASCII convertor

This program converts Image to ASCII text. It mainly uses [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) - Python Imaging Library and [Easygui](https://pypi.org/project/easygui/) library. 

I made this just for fun.

## Installation

First download the all files from this github repository. And use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Image to ASCII using [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)- 
* run the main.py file
* select a image using the file open box
* wait for your default browser to open a html file with your ASCII text

**Note - Images with higher resolution take a few minutes.**
